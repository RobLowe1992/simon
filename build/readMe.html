<p>About:
This is a clone of the game Simon. The ojective of the game is to watch a sequence of lights flash and then attempt to match them. Passing the level will cause the number of flashes to increment by one. Failing to pass the level will reset the game at level 1.</p>

<p>Technologies Used:
This game was built using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. The javascript includes concepts and features of the language in ES6.</p>

<p>Game Modes:
The game features two different games, Easy and Hard mode. In Hard mode the game board spins as the you play game.</p>

<p>Local Storage:
The game features local storage which saves the highest score the user reaches.</p>

<p>Installation Instructions:
This game can be played through github pages or you could clone the the repository from github and play the game locally.</p>

<p>Unresolved Issues:
I should have come up with a way to save the high scores for easy mode and hard mode seperately.</p>
